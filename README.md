# Exact Radix-4 Booth Multiplier

This repository contains the implementation of an exact radix-4 Booth multiplier in Verilog. The design includes five distinct modules, each contributing to the overall functionality of the multiplier. The simulation has been conducted using ModelSim, and the results of the product of an 8-bit multiplier and multiplicand are stored in a `product.txt` file.

## Modules Overview

### 1. HalfAdder
The `HalfAdder` module is responsible for adding two single-bit binary numbers. It produces a sum and a carry as outputs.

### 2. FullAdder
The `FullAdder` module adds three single-bit binary numbers (including carry-in from a previous addition). It outputs a sum and a carry, facilitating multi-bit binary addition in subsequent stages.

### 3. Encoder
The `Encoder` module performs the radix-4 Booth encoding. It processes groups of three bits of the multiplier to generate encoded signals, which are used to determine the partial products in the Booth multiplication process.

### 4. Decoder
The `Decoder` module decodes the signals generated by the Encoder to produce the appropriate partial products. These partial products are then summed to obtain the final product.

### 5. BoothMultiplier
The `BoothMultiplier` module integrates the functionality of the Encoder and Decoder. It orchestrates the entire multiplication process by controlling the generation and summation of partial products based on the radix-4 Booth algorithm.

## Simulation

The simulation of this exact radix-4 Booth multiplier is performed using ModelSim. The simulation ensures that the design behaves as expected under different test cases. The results, including the product of 8-bit multiplier and multiplicand, are stored in a `product.txt` file for verification and further analysis.
